# Entertain Me

EntertainMe is a website for movie enthusiasts to be able to access key information about movies and leave their personal review for films they have watched.<br>
The benefit of the site is that it is an easy way for users to keep a log of movies they have watched. The simple search functionality means users can also quickly find and recall key movie information including actors and year of release. Having a log of your personal movie reviews is beneficial in a time when more of us are spending more time in front of our screens. You can easily recommend movies to friends based on your own personal review list. <br>
